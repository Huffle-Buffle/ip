# AI assisted increment file :p

Note: This file was made so that I can do the AI assisted increment as I don't really understand the instruction so yes I made this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Tools Used

- ChatGPT (GPT-5)

### How the AI has been used 

- Used AI to generate the Javadoc comments for this iP project
- Asked AI for help when I don't really understand the task or how to go about a certain increment
- Debugging when I am stuck
- Used AI to help with improving the code quality as per the increment in week 5
- Used it to generate test cases for the code
- Suggestions to avoid coding standard breaches and good practices

### Observations

- AI saved a lot of time on writing repetitive documentation such as the javadoc comments as a lot of it was the same and I think we can use that time that we spend writing the comments elsewhere :D
- Most code suggestions were correct, but I had to review and tweak them to fit into the existing code structure I currently have as it gives very general code
- The AI is good at generating new and unexpected unit test cases, I think it is good that we get it to test our iP as if I were to write a test case, I 
would definitely write something that would pass as I am the developer so naturally if there was something not working why would I not go and fix it? 
The AI has helped me run a bunch of unexpected test and actually managed to help me catch a bug where my parser was not working properly as I did not make an 
exception case for that. Overall it is very insightful and I like that it helps to give you so many more angles when looking at the same problem.
- Using AI sped up development, but I still needed to understand and verify the code to make sure it worked as intended or meets the requirements for the increment
- All in all, AI helped to automate tasks such as comments, improve code quality etc giving me the developer more time to improve on the iP instead of doing repetitive tasks so allowing 
me to use my time and skills in other areas to make bigger improvements to the project
